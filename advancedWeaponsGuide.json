        "point": "Melee Weapons - Machetes and other weapons can generally take someone out in 2 hits, if they were at full health, and also have a fairly wide swing, meaning it’s hard to miss someone that’s right in front of you."
      },
      {
        "point": "Pistols - The firing mode of a pistol can’t be changed, meaning you can only fire one shot at a time. Despite packing some decent damage, this limits the usefulness of a pistol in close quarters combat, unless you’ve a good aim."
      },
      {
        "point": "Shotguns - As you might expect, the firing mode of a shotgun can’t be changed, meaning you’ll always be limited to a single shot before having to cock the gun again. Although incredibly powerful, shotguns should be used with care and attention when in close quarters."
      },
      {
        "point": "UMP - The UMP can change between single, burst, and auto firing modes, meaning it could arguably be the best close quarters weapon. Although the UMP packs some fairly hefty recoil, it is ideal for gunning down anyone within 100 yards of you."
      },
      {
        "point": "Uzi - As you might imagine, the Uzi is best for close quarters combat, and close quarters combat only. While it does have a single shot mode, the accuracy and recoil of the Uzi are poor, meaning you should realistically save it for battles within buildings."
